# CellFie-Python
work in progress conversion of the CellFie application from matlab to python (original code - https://github.com/LewisLabUCSD/CellFie)

# next steps:
- create file structure to resemble original repo
- edit file path variables in CellFie function to work in the same way as the matlab code
- make sure code works with secratory data
- test on full test suite
- create full python conversion of the runCellfie.py file

# usage:
1. clone repo, navigate to the repo's location on disk
2. excecute 'runCellFie_quickstart.py' to run the function using the parameters and data from the 'quickstart' on the CellFie wiki and write the output to csv files (https://github.com/LewisLabUCSD/CellFie/wiki/Running-CellFie-in-Matlab#quick-start)
